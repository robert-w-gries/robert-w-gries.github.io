I am a Software Engineer from the Midwest who spends his time programming, playing board games, and playing amateur ice hockey.

As a full stack developer, my experience encapsulates many areas of interest

* embedded systems
* operating systems
* virtualization
* web development

Programming is not just my work; it's my passion. I am driven by challenge and enjoy the opportunity to express creativity through problem solving.  When I contribute my solutions to the open source community, I feel a greater sense of purpose and motivation to improve myself so I can improve the world.
