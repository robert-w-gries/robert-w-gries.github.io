# Who is Robert Gries?

I am a Software Engineer forom the Midwest who spends his time programming, playing board games, and playing amateur ice hockey.  Living in North Carolina has sparked my interests in kayaking and hiking.

As a full stack developer, my experience ranges from embedded and operating systems to web development and virtualziation.  Programming is not just work for me; it is my passion through which I express creativity in problem solving and feel a greater sense of purpose by contributing to the rapidly developing open source community.
