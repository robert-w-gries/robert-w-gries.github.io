I am a Software Engineer from the Midwest who spends his time programming, playing board games, and playing amateur ice hockey.  Now living in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, I have been able to explore my interests in the outdoors, including kayaking and hiking.

As a full stack developer, my experience ranges from embedded and operating systems to web development and virtualization.  Programming is not just work for me; it is my passion through which I express creativity in problem solving and feel a greater sense of purpose by contributing to the rapidly developing open source community.
