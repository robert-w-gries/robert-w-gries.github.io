rXinu is an educational kernel written in Rust.

# Goals

## Primary
* Support an Operating Systems course that teaches students how to build a Rust kernel from scratch.
* Provide students the best opportunity to learn Operating Systems by introducing a language that enforces thread-safe and memory-safe code at compile time and thus improving productivity.
* Create an extensible microkernel that can be used for research purposes.

## Secondary
* Inspire students to contribute to an open source project and learn about OSdev beyond the scope of the Operating Systems and Compilers courses.
* Integrate modern tools into the coursework to increase experience with professional development techniques, such as continuous integration, a regression testing framework, static analysis, and performance testing.
* Prove the performance and feasibility of a low level project written in Rust.
* Explore the Rust language and mine the languageâ€™s features to make the kernel as stable and scalable as possible.
