Here are some projects and open source contributions that display my versalitiy.

# Industry Work

# Open Source Contributions

## rXinu

[Read more about rXinu here](/rxinu/)

## [blog_os](https://github.com/phil-opp/blog_os) - Rust Kernel

>This blog series creates a small operating system in the Rust programming language. Each post is a small tutorial and includes all needed code, so you can follow along if you like.

I am both a contributor to and a user of this repository.  I followed the blog series to create a kernel with a memory allocator and minimal interrupt handling, then extended this minimal kernel to create rXinu.

Since `blog_os` was so integral to the development of `rXinu`, I have contributed pull requests and have resolved issues to pay forward to other developers depending on this important project.

## [multiboot2-elf64](https://github.com/phil-opp/multiboot2-elf64)

A Multiboot2 library written in Rust.  This crate is mostly used in Rust kernels to read basic information passed by the Multiboot2 compliant bootloader.

As a collaborator, I assist in maintaining this project and ensuring the latest nightly Rust compiler is supported.
